# 🦅 stAItuned Editorial OS
## The Operating System for High-Impact Content
### *Pitch Deck*

---

## 1. The Problem: Content Chaos
**Modern content teams are drowning in fragmentation.**

*   ❌ **Discovery Gap:** Manually scouring 50+ tabs to find "what's trending."
*   ❌ **Context Switching:** Jumping between Google Docs, SEO tools, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
*   ❌ **Generic AI:** ChatGPT writes "fluff" that sounds like a robot, not *your* brand.
*   ❌ **Distribution Fatigue:** Great articles die because repurposing for social takes too long.

**Result:** Slow output, low engagement, and burnt-out teams.

## 2. The Solution: A Unified Intelligence Layer
**STAiTuned** is not just another writing tool. It is an **Agentic Workspace** where AI agents live alongside your editors.

*   ✅ **One Command Center:** Research, Write, SEO, and Distribute in one place.
*   ✅ **Deep Context:** It knows your Brand Voice, History, and Audience.
*   ✅ **Interactive Co-Creation:** You are the pilot, the AI is the engine. The system interviews *you* to extract your unique POV.

> *"Turn your content operation into a high-precision newsroom."*
