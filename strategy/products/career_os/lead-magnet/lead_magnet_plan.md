# Career OS — Lead Magnets (Spec + Priorities)

> **Goal:** generate qualified leads, validate ICP + pricing, and convert into Career OS (Start / Pro / Elite).
>
> **Principle:** the **FREE** version must deliver a real “aha / upgrade” by itself. The **BONUS/PREMIUM** version should be your unfair advantage: templates, systems, examples, and your personal setup.

## 0) How we judge a lead magnet (definition of “good”)

A lead magnet is “good” if it:

* **Solves 1 sharp pain** in ≤ 30–60 minutes
* Produces an **artifact/output** (not just knowledge)
* Has a clear **next step CTA** (Audit → Apply → Call)
* Is **scannable** (checklists, tables, examples)

**Minimum success criteria per magnet (global):**

* Free version: user can *do* something immediately (a checklist, a score, a template used once)
* Bonus: user can *replicate* a system (repeatable, operational)

# Prioritization — What to build first (and why)

## Tier A — Build NOW (highest leverage, fastest loop)

### A1) Role Fit Audit

**Why:** directly qualifies and routes leads into application/call. Fast feedback loop.

* Low production time
* High conversion intent
* Gives you segmentation data (dev vs data, years exp, urgency)

### A2) GenAI Career Roadmap 2026 (Free poster)

**Why:** easiest high-volume magnet; creates top-of-funnel demand; pairs perfectly with comment-to-get.

* Quick to produce
* High shareability
* Strong “anti-chaos” positioning

### A3) Supervised Vibe Coding Playbook (Free)

**Why:** differentiator + authority; attracts the exact builder ICP; not generic.

* Strong uniqueness
* Bridges to Pro (portfolio + flagship tool)

## Tier B — Build next (improves conversion + mid-funnel)

### B1) CV Tailoring Checklist (Free)

**Why:** solves immediate pain (“no callbacks”), increases trust and readiness.

### B2) Interview Cheat Sheet (Free)

**Why:** great for leads already interviewing; can spike conversion when timed.

## Tier C — Build later (maintenance heavy / depends on fresh data)

### C1) Salary & Market Report

**Why:** high perceived value but needs ongoing updates and reliable sources; do it once you have momentum.

# Notes on “Free vs Bonus” (best practice)

**Free should feel complete**: “I can apply this today.”
**Bonus should feel like acceleration**: “I can replicate your system faster + with less risk.”

A simple rule:

* Free = **one loop** completed
* Bonus = **system** to repeat the loop reliably

---
