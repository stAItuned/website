## Slide 1 — Title

**Competitive Landscape & Strategy**

*Where stAItuned wins: The gap between "learning" and "getting hired".*

**Subtitle**: Positioning against Bootcamps, Tools, and Agencies.

**Confidential — Internal Strategy**

---

## Slide 2 — The Job-to-be-Done

**Headline**: Juniors don't want "skills". They want "hired".

### The Customer's JTBD

> "I want to figure out which AI role is right for me, become hire-ready fast, get interviews, and prove I'm good enough."

### The 3 Axes of Competition

1. **Education** ("I learn skills") → Bootcamps / Coursera
2. **Optimization** ("I fix my CV") → CV Services / Agencies
3. **Automation** ("I do it myself") → AI Tools / Jobscan

**Our Wedge**: We are not just content, not just advice, not just a tool. We are a **System with Deliverables**.

---

## Slide 3 — Competitive Landscape

**Headline**: Why we are different from the rest.

| Archetype | Promise | Weakness | Our Opportunity |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Bootcamps** (start2impact, Epicode) | "Train & Place" | Slow (6mo+), Generalist, Expensive | **Speed + AI Focus + Proof** |
| **CV Services** (Agencies, Freelancers) | "Polish & Fix" | Low impact, no strategy, no proof | **System + Strategy + Proof** |
| **SaaS Tools** (Jobscan, Teal) | "Optimize & Track" | No guidance, "spray & pray", no outcome assurance | **Expert Guidance + Quality Gates** |
| **Self-Learning** (Coursera, Udemy) | "Learn Skills" | Infinite loop, no market signal | **Deliverables + Candidability** |

---

## Slide 4 — Vs. Bootcamps

**Category**: Direct Substitute (High Ticket)
**Examples**: start2impact, Epicode, Boolean

### Why they win
- Structure, Brand, "Job Guarantee" illusion

### Where we win (Attack Vector)
1. **Speed**: 4-8 weeks vs 6+ months
2. **Focus**: AI role-fit (specialized) vs Generalist Data/Web
3. **Proof**: Public Portfolio (Article/Project) vs Generic Exercises
4. **Guidance**: **AI Expert Team** (Hiring Managers) vs Tutors/Teachers

> **Battlecard**: "They sell education. We sell candidability. Don't spend 6 months learning before you start applying."

---

## Slide 5 — Vs. Tools & Services

**Category**: Low-Cost Substitute / Commodity
**Examples**: Jobscan, Rezi, CV Writers

### Why they win
- Cheap ($20-$150), Immediate gratification

### Where we win (Attack Vector)
1. **Strategy**: We solve "Which role?" (Role-fit)
2. **Quality**: Expert review vs Automated keywords
3. **Proof**: Tools don't build a portfolio; we do.
4. **Outcome**: We sell "Interview Ready", they sell "Optimized File"

> **Battlecard**: "Tools are commodities. A better CV doesn't fix a weak narrative. You need a system and proof."

## Slide 6 — Positioning Matrix

**Headline**: The Sweet Spot — High Certainty, Fast Outcome.

```
                    HIGH OUTCOME CERTAINTY
                           ↑
                           |
    Bootcamps ──────────┐  |  ┌──────── stAItuned
    (slow, structured)  |  |  |        (fast, proven)
                        |  |  |
    ←───────────────────┼──┼──┼───────────────────→
       SLOW                 |              FAST
       TIME-TO-OUTCOME      |              TIME-TO-OUTCOME
                        |  |  |
    Self-learning ──────┘  |  └──────── Tools/CV Services
    (low certainty)     ↓     (fast, low impact)
                           |
                    LOW OUTCOME CERTAINTY
```

**Key Positioning**: *"Faster than bootcamps. Deeper than CV services. Proof included."*

---

## Slide 7 — Moat & Defensibility

**Headline**: Features are copyable. The System is not.

### 4 Layers of Defense

1.  **AI Expert Guidance** (Hardest to copy)
    *   Senior practitioners who hire & build AI. Real insider knowledge.
    *   *Competitors have: Career coaches or generic tutors.*

2.  **Proprietary Playbook**
    *   Role-fit frameworks, Rubrics, SOPs.
    *   *Competitors have: Generic advice.*

3.  **Proof Engine (Publisher Brand)**
    *   stAItuned as a credible publishing platform.
    *   *Competitors have: Internal LMS submission.*

4.  **Community Flywheel**
    *   Alumni referring alumni, peer validation.

---

## Slide 8 — Pricing Implications

**Headline**: Justify the premium over tools, undercut the bootcamps.

### The Corridor
- **Tools**: €30/mo
- **Services**: €150 one-off
- **Bootcamps**: €3,000+

### Our Strategy
- **Positioning**: High-end Outcome accelerator.
- **Justification**: We are not a "course" (cheap) or a "tool" (cheap). We are a **Career System**.
- **Value Anchor**: Compare to the *outcome* (getting a €35k+ job), not the *input* (hours of video).

**Risk Reversal**: "Deliverable Guarantee" (e.g. Publishable Article or Extra Support).

---

## Slide 9 — Vulnerabilities & Defense

| Vulnerability | Why it's a risk | Our Defense |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **"I'll do a bootcamp"** | Perceived safety | We are for those who have bases but need *market fit* fast. |
| **"I'll use ChatGPT"** | Free alternative | AI generates text, we generate *proof & strategy*. |
| **"It's too expensive"** | vs Tools | Show the cost of *waiting* 6 months (lost salary). |

---
