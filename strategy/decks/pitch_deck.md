# stAItuned Career OS — Pitch Deck (16 slides + optional appendix)

## Slide 1 — Title

**Title:** stAItuned Career OS
**Subtitle:** Outcome-based career system for AI juniors — *hire-ready fast + proof that gets interviews*
**Footer:** “4 weeks: candidable. 8 weeks: credible.”

**Visual**

* Clean hero: 3 icons → *Role Fit → Applications → Proof*

**Speaker cue**

* “We’re not another course. We’re a system that turns juniors into credible AI candidates with deliverables.”

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem (what juniors face)

**Headline:** AI careers are confusing — and the market punishes lack of proof.

**Bullets**

* AI job roles are fragmented (AI Eng / ML Eng / GenAI Eng / DS) → juniors don’t know what to target.
* They apply with generic profiles → low ATS match + weak narrative.
* Most don’t have public proof: no published content, no portfolio-grade project, no clear story.
* Result: months of study + lots of applications → few interviews.

**Visual**

* 3 pain pillars: **Confusion / Ineffective applications / No proof**

**Speaker cue**

* “The problem is not ‘lack of learning’. It’s lack of *direction* and *credible evidence*.”

---

## Slide 3 — The Job-to-be-Done (what they’ll pay for)

**Headline:** Juniors don’t pay for content. They pay for outcomes.

**JTBD statement**

* “I want to know which AI role fits me, become hire-ready quickly, get interviews, and prove credibility.”

**What “hire-ready” means**

* Target role decided + narrative built
* CV/LinkedIn aligned to the role
* Tailored applications that match real job descriptions
* Interview scripts + practice plan

**What “credible” means**

* Public proof (published article) + technical proof (mini project)

**Visual**

* Simple funnel: *Clarity → Candidability → Credibility → Interviews*

---

## Slide 4 — Our Solution (what stAItuned Career OS is)

**Headline:** An outcome-based Career OS for AI roles — with a built-in Proof Engine.

**What it is**

* A guided system (initially 1:1, then cohorts) delivering:

  1. Role-fit decision + roadmap
  2. Hire-ready profile + tailored applications
  3. Proof Engine: public + technical assets

**Outcomes**

* **In 4 weeks (Starter):** role-fit + CV/LinkedIn + **3 tailored JD applications** + interview basics + **1 published article on stAItuned**
* **In 8 weeks (Pro):** + **10 tailored JD applications**, **job targeting assistance**, and a **portfolio-grade mini project**

**Visual**

* “Outcome timeline” strip: Week 1 → Week 4 → Week 8

---

## Slide 5 — Why Now (market timing)

**Headline:** AI roles are growing, but signal quality is collapsing.

**Bullets**

* Everyone can generate “good enough” resumes and cover letters with AI.
* Recruiters increasingly filter based on **evidence**: projects, clarity of role, strong narrative.
* Juniors need a system that converts AI learning into **proof and interviews** fast.

**Visual**

* Wave chart concept: “AI tools increase output” → “signal/noise problem” → “proof becomes currency”

---

## Slide 6 — Market Placement (where we sit)

**Headline:** We’re not a bootcamp. Not a CV service. Not just a tool.

**Competitive categories**

* Bootcamps/academies: long + expensive + standardized
* CV/LinkedIn services: cheap + narrow
* SaaS tools: cheap + self-serve
* Self-learning subscriptions: progress illusion

**Our positioning**

* **Outcome system**: strategy + QA + proof engine
* Faster time-to-value than bootcamps, deeper outcome than CV services/tools

**Visual**

* 2×2 map:

  * X: time-to-outcome (slow → fast)
  * Y: outcome certainty (low → high)
  * Place: Bootcamps (slow/high-ish), tools (fast/low), CV services (fast/low-mid), **stAItuned (fast/high)**

---

## Slide 7 — Competitor Analysis (who we really compete with)

**Headline:** Our real competitors are “alternatives,” not just mentors.

**Archetypes**

1. **Bootcamps** (high ticket + financing/risk reversal)
2. **CV/LinkedIn services** (low ticket commodity)
3. **ATS/job search SaaS** (cheap tools)
4. **Self-learning** (Coursera/DataCamp + free student AI tooling)

**Why they win**

* Bootcamps: structure + community + pay-later
* CV services: cheap quick fix
* Tools: speed
* Self-learning: low cost + “I’m progressing”

**How we beat them**

* We compress “hire-ready” to 4 weeks and “credible” to 8 weeks via deliverables + QA + proof.

**Visual**

* Table: Competitor → “What they sell” → “Why it fails for AI hires” → “Our advantage”

---

## Slide 8 — Our Wedge: Proof Engine (what makes it work)

**Headline:** Proof beats promises — we make proof the product.

**Proof Engine**

* **Public proof**: 1 stAItuned article published (Starter included)
* **Technical proof**: mini project with repo/demo + writeup (Pro/Elite)
* Proof is designed to be:

  * role-aligned (not generic)
  * shareable (LinkedIn-ready)
  * verifiable (public + reproducible)

**Why proof matters**

* It increases trust, improves narrative, and raises interview probability.
* It compounds as the stAItuned library grows.

**Visual**

* “Proof stack” graphic: Article (public) + Project (technical)

---

## Slide 9 — Products in the Path (tooling that scales delivery + monetization)

**Headline:** Tools are accelerators inside the program — and recurring monetization after it.

**Products used during delivery**

1. **Career OS Tools**

   * JD tailoring (CV+cover), rubric scoring, checklists
2. **Editorial Planner**

   * article workflow: outline → draft → QA checklist → publish
   * includes LinkedIn share kit
3. **Builder (Pro)**

   * supervised vibe-coding workflow to ship a small demo/repo

**Why this matters**

* Tools standardize output quality and reduce human hours.
* They become post-program monetization via credits/subscription.

**Visual**

* Timeline with tool logos under each stage

---

## Slide 10 — The Offers (Starter / Pro / Elite) — crystal clear

**Headline:** Three tiers, one outcome ladder. Pro is the best seller.

### Starter (4 weeks) — includes 1 article

* Role-fit + 30/60/90 roadmap
* CV + LinkedIn optimization (rubric-based)
* **3 JD personalizations** (CV + cover) via tool + our review
* Interview basics (pitch + scripts)
* **1 article published on stAItuned** (QA + revision limits)

### Pro (8 weeks) — best seller

* Everything in Starter +
* **10 JD personalizations**
* **Job targeting assistance:** role synonyms, keywords, search queries, filters → replicable shortlist
* Mini project (repo/demo + writeup)
* **Optional extra tool credits** (JD/articles/reviews)

### Elite

* Everything in Pro +
* 12 months tool access (cap/credits)
* monthly office hours + priority review

**Visual**

* 3-column comparison table + “what scales value” bar (3 JD → 10 JD → targeting → project → ongoing access)

---

## Slide 11 — End-to-End Delivery (the “How” timeline)

**Headline:** A structured process with clear deliverables every week.

**Step 0 — Application & onboarding**

* baseline CV/LinkedIn audit + role hypotheses
* constraints & schedule

**Week 1 — Role-fit**

* decide target role + 1 adjacent role
* narrative + roadmap 30/60/90

**Week 2 — CV/LinkedIn**

* aligned to role keywords + story
* publish-ready LinkedIn structure

**Week 3 — JD tailoring**

* Starter: 3 JD; Pro: 10 JD
* build “bullet bank” and templates

**Week 4 — Search strategy + interview basics**

* weekly application plan + interview scripts

**Weeks 5–8 (Pro/Elite) — credibility expansion**

* Job targeting shortlist (queries/filters)
* Article pipeline (Editorial Planner + QA + publish)
* Mini project (scope → build → review → publish)

**Visual**

* Gantt-style timeline with deliverables per week + tool tags

---

## Slide 12 — Business Model (how the company makes money)

**Headline:** Program revenue now; recurring tool revenue later.

**Revenue streams**

1. **Programs:** Starter / Pro / Elite (one-off; optionally instalments)
2. **Credits upsell:** extra JD packs, extra articles, extra reviews/priority
3. **Subscription later:** tool access for alumni
4. Future: B2B productized (only after repeatable pilots)

**Monetization logic**

* Programs fund execution and produce proof
* Proof drives inbound
* Tool credits/subscriptions create recurring revenue with low incremental time

**Visual**

* “Revenue stack” diagram: Programs → Credits → Subscription base

---

## Slide 13 — Pricing Strategy (principles + concrete options)

**Headline:** Fixed tiers. Codified discounts. Deliverable-based risk reversal.

**Rules**

* Fixed pricing per tier (no negotiation)
* Discounts only: early bird / limited scholarships / referral
* Optional instalments (2–3) to counter bootcamp financing
* Risk reversal soft: **deliverables guaranteed**, not “job guaranteed”

**Price corridor**

* Above CV services, below bootcamps — justified by speed + proof

**Price options (choose one strategy)**

* **Balanced:** Starter €590 | Pro €1,190 | Elite €1,990
* **Premium:** Starter €790 | Pro €1,490 | Elite €2,490
* **Accessible + scholarships:** Starter €449 | Pro €990 | Elite €1,690 (+ 2–3 scholarship seats/mo)

**Cohort pricing (when scaling)**

* 4w cohort €199–€449; 8w cohort €399–€899
* 1:1 add-on review 30’ €79–€129

**Visual**

* Pricing table with 3 scenarios + “value metric ladder”

---

## Slide 14 — Unit Economics & Scalability (work-life balance by design)

**Headline:** We engineer for margin per hour and predictable scope.

**Constraints**

* Human time is the bottleneck; scope creep kills margin.

**Scalability levers**

* SOP + templates + rubric scoring
* Tools reduce marginal time per user
* 1:1 used for learning (first 5–10 clients)
* Shift to cohort-lite → cohorts
* Credits cap variable tool costs

**What we measure**

* hours per user per tier
* completion rate of deliverables
* conversion to credits/subscription
* interviews per cohort

**Visual**

* Concept chart: time/user decreases across phases; margin increases

---

## Slide 15 — Moat (defensibility)

**Headline:** The moat is the system + proof network, not “AI tools.”

**Moat layers**

1. Proprietary playbook (role-fit framework, rubrics, SOPs, templates)
2. Publishing platform effect (stAItuned as proof publisher)
3. Data advantage (JD patterns + gaps + winning narratives)
4. Alumni/community flywheel (referrals + peer proof)
5. Talent pipeline (top alumni → contributors behind QA gates)

**Why it’s hard to copy**

* Competitors can copy features; harder to copy a continuously improving system + proof library + community.

**Visual**

* “Castle & moat” diagram with 5 layers

---

## Slide 16 — Roadmap & Gates (how we execute without becoming an agency)

**Headline:** Stage-gated growth: validate → scale → productize.

**Phase 0: 1:1 (first 5–10 clients)**

* goal: validate promise, finalize SOPs, build proof case studies

**Gate**

* 10 completions + 2–3 case studies + time/user under target

**Phase 1: cohort-lite**

* weekly workshop + limited reviews; maintain outcomes

**Phase 2: tool monetization**

* credits/subscription becomes meaningful; alumni retention

**Phase 3: B2B productized (future)**

* only if repeatable: 3+ similar clients → standard package

**Visual**

* Stage-gate roadmap with checkboxes and unlock conditions

---

## Slide 17 — Risks & Mitigations (credibility + delivery)

**Headline:** We protect quality and margin with strict guardrails.

**Risks**

* Scope creep / agency trap
* Junior price sensitivity
* Public proof quality risk
* Token/tool cost leakage
* “Job guarantee” expectations

**Mitigations**

* strict included/excluded + revision limits
* scholarships codified + instalments
* QA rubrics for publishing
* credits + caps for tool usage
* guarantee deliverables, not job outcomes

**Visual**

* Risk table: Risk → Mitigation

---

## Slide 18 — Call to Action (what we want)

Choose based on audience.

**If pitching to customers (B2C)**

* “Apply for the next cohort / book a 15’ audit”
* “Limited spots to maintain quality”

**If pitching to partners (universities/communities)**

* “Partner with us for a cohort for your community”
* “Co-branded publishing and proof outcomes”

**If pitching to collaborators**

* “We’re building the playbook + tooling; looking for contributors under QA gates”

**Visual**

* One clear CTA button + “next cohort date” placeholder
