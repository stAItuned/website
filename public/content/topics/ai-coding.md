## What are AI Coding Assistants?

**AI Coding Assistants** are tools that integrate LLMs directly into the software development lifecycle. Ranging from IDE extensions like **copilot** to autonomous agents that can plan and edit complete files, these tools aim to augment developer productivity by automating boilerplate, generating tests, and explaining complex codebases.

## When to focus on this

*   **Boosting Productivity:** Leveraging autocomplete for repetitive patterns and boilerplate code so you can focus on system design.
*   **Legacy Code Modernization:** Using AI to explain, document, and refactor old codebases that no one understands anymore.
*   **Learning New Stacks:** Using chat interfaces to quickly learn the syntax and patterns of a new language or framework correctly.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Blind Trust:** Accepting AI-generated code without review. AI often writes plausible-looking but subtly incorrect or insecure code.
*   **Context blindness:** Most simple autocomplete tools only see the current file. They often miss important context from other parts of the codebase, leading to import errors or type mismatches.
*   **Skill Atrophy:** Relying so heavily on generation that you forget (or never learn) the underlying syntax and logic, making you helpless without the tool.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Will AI replace programmers?</summary>
Unlikely in the near future. It will replace *coding* (typing syntax) but not *programming* (solving problems and designing systems). The role is shifting from "writer of code" to "architect and reviewer of code".

<details>
<summary>How is an Agent different from Autocomplete?</summary>
Autocomplete (like Copilot) predicts the next few lines based on your cursor. An Agent (like Cursor's Composer or Windsurf) can plan a multi-file change, run terminal commands, debug errors, and iterate until the task is done.
