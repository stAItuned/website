## What are AI Research Workflows?

This topic focuses on **AI-augmented research**: using tools to search, synthesize, and analyze vast amounts of information. It moves beyond simple "chat" to deep research workflows where AI agents scan internet sources, read academic papers, citations, and datasets to generate comprehensive reports or answer complex queries that require verifying multiple sources.

## When to focus on this

*   **Deep Dives:** When you need to understand a new field quickly (e.g., "What is the state of the art in battery technology?") without reading 50 papers manually.
*   **Literature Review:** Automating the process of finding relevant prior art and summarizing key findings for academic or business reports.
*   **Fact-Checking:** Using systems that cross-reference LLM generations against reliable web sources to ensure accuracy.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Hallucinated Citations:** Early models notoriously invented book titles and paper authors. Modern tools mitigate this, but verifying sources is still mandatory.
*   **Echo Chambers:** AI search tools often prioritize the most SEO-optimized content on the web, potentially missing niche or contrarian academic viewpoints.
*   **Surface-Level Analysis:** While AI is great at summarization, it sometimes misses the subtle, critical details or flaws in a methodology that a human expert would catch.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>What is Perplexity?</summary>
Perplexity is a popular "Answer Engine" that combines an LLM with a real-time search engine. It reads search results and synthesizes a direct answer with citations, rather than just giving you a list of links.

<summary>Can AI read PDFs?</summary>
Yes. Most modern research tools use RAG to ingest PDF documents, chunk them into text, and allow you to "chat" with the document to extract specific information or summaries.
