## What are Case Studies?

This topic collects **real-world applications** of Artificial Intelligence. Theory is important, but seeing how models are applied to solve concrete problems in specific industries is where the value becomes tangible.

## Industries Covered

*   **Healthcare:** Early diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.
*   **Gaming:** NPC behavior, procedural generation, and player experience modeling.
*   **Finance:** Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.
*   **Agriculture:** Crop monitoring, yield prediction, and automated harvesting.

## Why read these?

*   **Inspiration:** See what's possible and get ideas for your own domain.
*   **Practicality:** Understand the challenges of deploying AI in "messy" real-world environments (data privacy, latency, hardware constraints).
*   **Impact:** Move beyond the hype to see actual measurable results.
