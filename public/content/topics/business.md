## What is AI for Business?

This topic addresses the **strategic layer** of Artificial Intelligence. It is not about code, but about **value creation**. It covers how leaders and organizations can identify high-ROI use cases, manage the build-vs-buy decision, navigate the risks of AI adoption (data privacy, legal), and foster an AI-ready culture.

## When to focus on this

*   **Strategic Planning:** You are a founder or executive deciding where to allocate budget for AI initiatives over the next 12-24 months.
*   **Product Management:** You are defining features for a product and need to decide if AI actually solves a user problem or if it's just a gimmick.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** You are looking to automate internal workflows (Customer Support, Data Entry) to reduce costs and improve speed.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **AI for AI's Sake:** Implementing a chatbot or feature just to say "we have AI," without solving a real customer pain point.
*   **Underestimating Data Prep:** Thinking you can just "plug in AI" without having clean, structured data first. 80% of an AI project is usually data engineering.
*   **The "Magic Box" Expectation:** Expecting AI to be perfect immediately. Business AI requires "human-in-the-loop" workflows to handle edge cases and errors gracefully.

## FAQ

<summary>How do we measure ROI?</summary>
Focus on specific metrics: Time saved per task, reduction in support ticket volume, or increase in conversion rate. Avoid vague "productivity" metrics if possible.
