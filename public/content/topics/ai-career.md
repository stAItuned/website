## What is AI Career & Learning?

This topic focuses on navigating the **paradigm shift** in the job market caused by Artificial Intelligence. It covers **AI Literacy**, the rise of the **AI Engineer** role, and strategic adaptation for both technical and non-technical professionals. It's about moving from "fearing replacement" to "leveraging augmentation."

## When to focus on this

*   **Career Pivots:** You are a traditional developer, product manager, or data analyst looking to transition into an AI-focused role.
*   **Future-Proofing:** You want to understand which skills are becoming commodities (e.g., basic coding) and which are gaining value (e.g., system architecture, specialized domain knowledge).
*   **Hiring & Growth:** You are building a team and need to identify the right mix of "AI-native" talent.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **"Prompt Engineering" Obsession:** Focusing entirely on prompting techniques, which are rapidly being automated or abstracted away by smarter models.
*   **Ignoring Soft Skills:** In an AI world, communication, product sense, and the ability to define *what* to build become more valuable than just knowing *how* to build it.
*   **Paralysis by Analysis:** Spending months strictly "learning theory" without building shipping projects. The field moves too fast; you learn by building.
