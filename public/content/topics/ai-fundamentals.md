## What is AI & Data Science Fundamentals?

This topic covers the bedrock of modern intelligence systems. It spans from **classic algorithms** and **data structures** to the core principles of **Machine Learning** (Supervised, Unsupervised) and **Data Science** methodologies. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for anyone looking to build a career in technology or understand how data-driven decisions are made.

## Key Areas

*   **Algorithms:** The step-by-step procedures for calculation and data processing.
*   **Machine Learning Basics:** Understanding regression, classification, and the bias-variance tradeoff.
*   **Data Science Workflow:** From data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering.

## Why it matters

*   **Solid Foundation:** Advanced techniques like LLMs are built upon these basic principles.
*   **Problem Solving:** Many business problems can be solved with traditional ML more efficiently than with complex AI.
*   **Analytical Thinking:** Developing a data-centric mindset for evaluating information.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between AI and Machine Learning?</summary>
AI is the broad field of creating intelligent systems. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable computers to "learn" from data without being explicitly programmed.

<summary>Why is Data Cleaning important?</summary>
"Garbage in, garbage out." The quality of a model's output is directly limited by the quality of its training data.
