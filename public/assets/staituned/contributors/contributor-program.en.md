## ✍️ What We Are Looking For

We are looking for **original content** on GenAI and applied AI topics.

### ✅ Formats That Work

- **Practical Guides** — step-by-step tutorials, checklists, how-tos
- **Decision Frameworks** — when to use what, trade-offs, comparisons
- **Case Studies** — real implementations, "what worked" and "what didn't"
- **Lessons Learned** — mistakes, pitfalls, solutions found
- **Technical Deep Dives** — architectures, patterns, best practices

### ❌ What We Don't Publish

- Generic intros ("what is an LLM", "history of AI")
- Promotional or advertising content
- Hype without substance
- Copy/paraphrase from other sources

## 📝 Article Guidelines (suggestions, not constraints)

These are **suggestions** to help you write an effective article. They are not rigid rules.

| Aspect | Suggestion |
|---------|--------------|
| **Length** | ~1,500 words (flexible based on topic) |
| **Structure** | ~5 sections with clear headings |
| **Examples** | 1-2 concrete examples or use cases |
| **Takeaways** | Closing with key points / next steps |
| **Code** | If relevant, commented snippets (not mandatory) |
| **Images** | If you have them, great. Otherwise, we create them |

### The Process is Collaborative

You propose a topic and an outline. We suggest potential focus areas on GenAI or angles that work well with our audience. But the final choice is yours.

Choose the level of support you need. In any case, the final content will be optimized by our team to ensure SEO, GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), and maximum authority.

### 1. Autonomy Path — "You write, we optimize"
Ideal if you already have a draft ready or prefer to write offline.

- **Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes for the interview.

### 3. Interview Path — "Tell us your vision"
Reserved for Experts, C-Levels, and Industry Leaders (by selection). Turn your expertise into thought leadership without writing a single line.
